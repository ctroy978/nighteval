However, it lacks deeper critical analysis and has noticeable issues with language and mechanics that affect polish. To improve, focus on providing original insights and refining grammar and formatting for greater clarity and engagement.\",\"criteria\":[{\"id\":\"thesis_argument\",\"criterion\":\"Thesis and Argument\",\"description\":\"\",\"assigned_level\":\"Thesis is clear and focused, with a solid argument that adequately addresses the prompt.\",\"score\":3,\"examples\":[{\"excerpt\":\"Due to the disease’s relatedness in transmission, effects, and symptoms, it is the most likely origin of chronic wasting disease through the evolution of the virus.\",\"comment\":\"This thesis clearly outlines the main argument based on similarities between TSE and CWD, providing a focused direction for the essay that addresses the topic of origins adequately without major deviations.\"},{\"excerpt\":\"Despite this, one possible determination of CWD may be that it evolved from a preexisting disease. One such possibility that researchers know of is called transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (Emerging).\",\"comment\":\"The introduction sets up the argument by introducing the hypothesis of evolution from TSE, supporting a solid but not highly original claim that guides the rest of the discussion.\"}],\"improvement_suggestion\":\"To reach the top level where the thesis is clear, insightful, and effectively guides the entire essay with a strong, original argument, revise your thesis to incorporate a unique angle, such as potential ecological implications of this evolution. For example: 'Beyond mere similarities, the evolutionary adaptation of TSE prions to cervid biology, driven by shared habitats with livestock, positions it as the primary origin of CWD, with profound implications for wildlife management.' This change earns the top level by adding originality and insight, making the argument more compelling and directly tying to broader impacts for seamless guidance throughout the essay.\"},{\"id\":\"organization_coherence\",\"criterion\":\"Organization and Coherence\",\"description\":\"\",\"assigned_level\":\"Clear structure with effective transitions; ideas flow logically overall.\",\"score\":3,\"examples\":[{\"excerpt\":\"TSE is a disease transmitted in the same or similar ways when compared to CWD. These diseases can be transmitted in three ways: through bodily fluids, contaminated environmental factors (such as water or food), and infected carcasses (U.S. Geological Survey).\",\"comment\":\"This paragraph opening effectively transitions from the introduction to detailing transmission, maintaining a logical flow by building on the thesis's mention of relatedness.\"},{\"excerpt\":\"Having the same cause between differing diseases can create similarities between how symptoms of a disease act (Emerging). Symptoms that are commonly held between TSE and chronic wasting disease include behavioral changes, excessive drooling, weight loss, hair pulling, and incoordination (Merck & Chronic).\",\"comment\":\"The shift to symptoms builds coherently on prior sections about cause, with the topic sentence linking back to shared mechanisms, ensuring overall logical progression.\"}],\"improvement_suggestion\":\"Aim for the highest level of exceptional organization with seamless transitions and a coherent progression of ideas by ensuring each paragraph explicitly connects to the thesis and previous points. For instance, revise a transition to: 'Building on these shared transmission pathways and prion mechanisms, the symptoms further illustrate TSE's evolutionary link to CWD.'

These proteins are known as prions, which are often produced by mammals for common cellular functions and then recycled or degraded.\",\"comment\":\"The explanation of prions uses source-backed details to adequately develop the cause similarity, providing sufficient support for the evolutionary link claim.\"}],\"improvement_suggestion\":\"To achieve the top level of rich, relevant evidence from credible sources integrated smoothly to strongly support the argument, expand examples with more specific data or quotes from sources and weave them seamlessly. For example, revise to: 'As noted in the U.S. Geological Survey, prions in saliva can persist in soil for years, enabling exposure when deer graze on contaminated pastures near livestock areas—evidenced by outbreaks in regions with mixed farming (citation).'

For instance, revise the symptom discussion to: 'These overlapping symptoms, such as incoordination leading to increased predation risk, suggest not just relatedness but an adaptive mutation in prions favoring cervid survival strategies, challenging assumptions about prion host specificity (analysis based on Merck and Emerging).'
