Overall Score: 13/20 (13 / 20)
Summary:
The essay demonstrates a clear structure and adequate use of evidence to support its claim about the
origin of Chronic Wasting Disease, showing solid organization and development. However, it lacks
deeper critical analysis and has noticeable issues with language and mechanics that affect polish.
To improve, focus on providing original insights and refining grammar and formatting for greater
clarity and engagement.

Criteria:
thesis_argument — Thesis and Argument
Level: Thesis is clear and focused, with a solid argument that adequately addresses the prompt.    Score: 3
Description:
Thesis and Argument
Examples:
Excerpt:
Due to the disease’s relatedness in transmission, effects, and symptoms, it is the most likely
origin of chronic wasting disease through the evolution of the virus.
  Comment:
This thesis clearly outlines the main argument based on similarities between TSE and CWD, providing
a focused direction for the essay that addresses the topic of origins adequately without major
Excerpt:
Despite this, one possible determination of CWD may be that it evolved from a preexisting disease.
One such possibility that researchers know of is called transmissible spongiform encephalopathy
(Emerging).
  Comment:
The introduction sets up the argument by introducing the hypothesis of evolution from TSE,
supporting a solid but not highly original claim that guides the rest of the discussion.
Improvement Suggestion:
To reach the top level where the thesis is clear, insightful, and effectively guides the entire
essay with a strong, original argument, revise your thesis to incorporate a unique angle, such as
potential ecological implications of this evolution. For example: 'Beyond mere similarities, the
evolutionary adaptation of TSE prions to cervid biology, driven by shared habitats with livestock,
positions it as the primary origin of CWD, with profound implications for wildlife management.' This
change earns the top level by adding originality and insight, making the argument more compelling
and directly tying to broader impacts for seamless guidance throughout the essay.

organization_coherence — Organization and Coherence
Level: Clear structure with effective transitions; ideas flow logically overall.    Score: 3
Description:
Organization and Coherence
Examples:
Excerpt:
TSE is a disease transmitted in the same or similar ways when compared to CWD. These diseases can be
transmitted in three ways: through bodily fluids, contaminated environmental factors (such as water
or food), and infected carcasses (U.S. Geological Survey).
  Comment:
This paragraph opening effectively transitions from the introduction to detailing transmission,
maintaining a logical flow by building on the thesis's mention of relatedness.
Excerpt:
Having the same cause between differing diseases can create similarities between how symptoms of a
disease act (Emerging). Symptoms that are commonly held between TSE and chronic wasting disease
include behavioral changes, excessive drooling, weight loss, hair pulling, and incoordination (Merck
  Comment:
The shift to symptoms builds coherently on prior sections about cause, with the topic sentence
linking back to shared mechanisms, ensuring overall logical progression.
Improvement Suggestion:
Aim for the highest level of exceptional organization with seamless transitions and a coherent
progression of ideas by ensuring each paragraph explicitly connects to the thesis and previous
points. For instance, revise a transition to: 'Building on these shared transmission pathways and
prion mechanisms, the symptoms further illustrate TSE's evolutionary link to CWD.' This earns top
marks by creating fluid, insightful connections that enhance the essay's unity and make the argument
feel effortlessly integrated.

development_support — Development and Support
Level: Adequate evidence and examples that effectively support main points.    Score: 3
Description:
Development and Support
Examples:
Excerpt:
An example of how this may work is infected livestock leaving waste behind in a pasture and deer
passing through that pasture and being exposed (U.S. Geological Survey).
  Comment:
This concrete example illustrates transmission effectively, drawing from a credible source to
support the argument about cross-species spread without overcomplicating the point.
Excerpt:
Both diseases have been diagnosed as misfolded proteins in the brain (Merck). These proteins are
known as prions, which are often produced by mammals for common cellular functions and then recycled
or degraded.
  Comment:
The explanation of prions uses source-backed details to adequately develop the cause similarity,
providing sufficient support for the evolutionary link claim.
Improvement Suggestion:
To achieve the top level of rich, relevant evidence from credible sources integrated smoothly to
strongly support the argument, expand examples with more specific data or quotes from sources and
weave them seamlessly. For example, revise to: 'As noted in the U.S. Geological Survey, prions in
saliva can persist in soil for years, enabling exposure when deer graze on contaminated pastures
near livestock areas—evidenced by outbreaks in regions with mixed farming (citation).' This
top-level integration strengthens support by adding specificity and smooth flow, making the evidence
feel vital and persuasive to the thesis.

critical_analysis — Critical Analysis and Understanding
Level: Basic analysis present, but lacks depth or critical insight.    Score: 2
Description:
Critical Analysis and Understanding
Examples:
Excerpt:
This abnormal folding of proteins causes the cells to cease being broken down and to instead collect
in the brain (Merck). This leads to neurological damage and eventual death by eliminating brain
cells (Emerging).
  Comment:
The description of prion effects shows basic understanding but merely restates source information
without deeper interpretation of how this specifically enables evolution to CWD.
Excerpt:
Related symptoms not only show that the two are related in the ways that they infect, but also in
some of the ways of development and patterns of their decline in health (Chronic).
  Comment:
This points to symptom connections but offers only surface-level observation, lacking critical
insight into why these patterns suggest adaptation or implications for disease control.
Improvement Suggestion:
Strive for the highest level of sophisticated analysis with original insights and deep engagement by
questioning sources and exploring implications. For instance, revise the symptom discussion to:
'These overlapping symptoms, such as incoordination leading to increased predation risk, suggest not
just relatedness but an adaptive mutation in prions favoring cervid survival strategies, challenging
assumptions about prion host specificity (analysis based on Merck and Emerging).' This attains top
marks through original interpretation that engages deeply with the material, adding insight beyond
description to elevate the essay's intellectual depth.

language_style_mechanics — Language, Style, and Mechanics
Level: Readable but with noticeable errors in grammar, style, or mechanics that affect clarity.    Score: 2
Description:
Language, Style, and Mechanics
Examples:
Excerpt:
This is a disease that causes the local populations of elk, deer, reindeer , and moose to die slowly
over a few years.
  Comment:
The sentence is readable but has minor spacing issues (e.g., 'reindeer ,') and awkward phrasing that
slightly disrupts flow and clarity.
Excerpt:
Their resistance to natural disease elimination methods may have contributed to the spread of
chronic wasting disease among deer populations.
  Comment:
This shows effective style in connecting ideas, but overall the essay suffers from inconsistent
formatting and word breaks (e.g., 'world’ s'), which noticeably impact professional polish and
readability.
Improvement Suggestion:
Target the top level of polished, engaging prose with precise language, varied sentences, and no
errors by proofreading for formatting and varying sentence structure. For example, revise the
introduction sentence to: 'Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy,
insidiously ravages global cervid populations—including elk, deer, reindeer, and moose—leading to
prolonged, fatal neurological decline.' This achieves excellence by eliminating errors, using
precise and varied language that engages the reader, and enhancing clarity to make the prose
sophisticated and error-free.
