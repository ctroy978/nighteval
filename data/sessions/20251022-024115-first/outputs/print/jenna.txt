Criteria:
thesis_argument — Thesis and Argument
Level: Thesis is clear and focused, with a solid argument that adequately addresses the prompt. (3)    Score: 3
Description:
Evaluates the clarity, insight, and guidance provided by the thesis in addressing the prompt.
Examples:
Excerpt:
Ultimately, as time went on, the Soviet leader allowed the Berlin wall to come down because he had a
broader vision for the Soviet Union and its role in the world. The main reasons for this are that he
wanted a more dynamic socialist system, there was a need for internal economic recovery, and he
  Comment:
This thesis clearly outlines the main reasons for Gorbachev's decision, providing a focused
structure that guides the essay and adequately addresses why the wall fell, demonstrating a solid
argument without
Excerpt:
In conclusion, the Soviet leader allowed the Berlin wall to come down because he had a broader
vision for the Soviet Union and its role in the world. The main reasons for this are that he wanted
a more dynamic socialist system, there was a need for internal economic recovery, and he desired to
  Comment:
The restatement in the conclusion reinforces the thesis effectively, maintaining relevance to the
prompt and tying the argument together, though it repeats phrasing without adding new insight.
Improvement Suggestion:
To reach the top level of a clear, insightful thesis that effectively guides the essay with a
strong, original argument, refine your thesis to include a unique perspective, such as emphasizing
Gorbachev's reforms as a deliberate pivot from ideological rigidity to pragmatic global integration.
For example, revise to: 'Gorbachev's allowance of the Berlin Wall's fall in 1989 stemmed from his
visionary reforms—Perestroika, Glasnost, and the Sinatra Doctrine—which not only revitalized the
Soviet economy and society but also redefined its global stance from confrontation to cooperation,
ultimately catalyzing the end of the Cold War divide.' This change earns the top level by
introducing originality and insight, showing deeper engagement with historical implications while
precisely directing the essay's focus.

organization_coherence — Organization and Coherence
Level: Clear structure with effective transitions; ideas flow logically overall. (3)    Score: 3
Description:
Assesses the structure, transitions, and logical flow of ideas throughout the essay.
Examples:
Excerpt:
Gorbachev allowed for the Berlin wall to be taken down because he sought a greater purpose for the
Soviet Union made possible by a socialist system with a more innovative approach. Perestroika was
Gorbachev’s policy introduced in 1985 to reform the Soviet Union’s stagnant economy and political
  Comment:
This transition from the thesis to the first body paragraph uses a clear topic sentence that links
back to the broader vision, ensuring logical progression and effective flow between ideas.
Excerpt:
However, these reforms placed other considerations on the economy for Mikhail Gorbachev. The Soviet
leader’s recognition of the Union’s dire need for internal economic recovery shifted concern away
from the Berlin Wall.
  Comment:
The use of 'However' signals a shift to the next reason, maintaining coherence by connecting
economic reforms to the overall argument, though the progression could feel more seamless with
varied
Improvement Suggestion:
Aim for the highest level by creating an exceptionally well-organized essay with seamless
transitions and a coherent progression of ideas, ensuring each paragraph builds cumulatively on the
last without repetition. For instance, instead of restating the thesis in the conclusion, bridge the
final body paragraph to it with: 'Building on these economic and diplomatic shifts, Gorbachev's
non-intervention ultimately transformed Eastern Europe.' This revision achieves top-level
organization by weaving ideas fluidly, enhancing the essay's unity and demonstrating masterful
control over structure for a more engaging read.

development_support — Development and Support
Level: Adequate evidence and examples that effectively support main points. (3)    Score: 3
Description:
Examines the use of evidence and examples to support the main points.
Examples:
Excerpt:
Perestroika was Gorbachev’s policy introduced in 1985 to reform the Soviet Union’s stagnant economy
and political system. Gorbachev’s perestroika program loosened centralized control of many
businesses, allowing some farmers and manufacturers to decide for themselves which products to make,
  Comment:
This section provides adequate historical details and a citation to explain Perestroika, effectively
supporting the claim about a dynamic socialist system with relevant examples of economic loosening.
Excerpt:
The country’s gross national product dropped from 5.8% in 1940 to 2.6% in 1970 (“Consequences of”).
The region’s large energy and raw material base had prompted the Soviet economy to rely little on
foreign trade throughout history. It was recorded in 1985 that exports and imports accounted for
  Comment:
Specific statistics and citations here adequately bolster the argument for economic recovery needs,
showing effective use of evidence to illustrate stagnation without overwhelming depth.
Improvement Suggestion:
To attain the top level with rich, relevant evidence from credible sources integrated smoothly to
strongly support the argument, incorporate more diverse sources and analyze their interconnections
explicitly. For example, expand a supporting detail by adding: 'As evidenced by declassified Soviet
archives and economic analyses from historians like Archie Brown, Perestroika's decentralization not
only spurred private enterprise but directly weakened East Germany's control mechanisms, paving the
way for the Wall's demolition.' This earns the highest score by seamlessly blending multiple
credible evidences with smooth integration, strengthening the argument's persuasiveness and
demonstrating comprehensive support.

critical_analysis — Critical Analysis and Understanding
Level: Solid analysis with clear interpretation and appropriate engagement with the topic. (3)    Score: 3
Description:
Evaluates the depth of analysis, insights, and engagement with the topic.
Examples:
Excerpt:
These policies show that Gorbachev was striving for a more dynamic socialist system because the
policies he installed paved the way for East Germans to demand reforms and protest to have the
Berlin Wall removed.
  Comment:
This interprets how Glasnost and Perestroika enabled protests, providing solid analysis that
connects reforms to the Wall's fall with appropriate engagement, though it remains somewhat
straightforward.
Excerpt:
Gorbachev’s non-intervention, rooted in the Sinatra Doctrine, allowed East German protests to
escalate. The Wall fell on November 9, 1989, after a bureaucratic error by a German Democratic
Republic official, with Gorbachev refusing to deploy Soviet troops (“Sinatra Doctrine”).
  Comment:
The analysis here clearly links the Sinatra Doctrine to non-intervention and the Wall's fall,
showing appropriate understanding and interpretation of Gorbachev's global repositioning.
Improvement Suggestion:
Strive for the pinnacle of sophisticated analysis with original insights and deep engagement by
exploring counterfactuals or broader implications. Revise a key analysis to: 'Gorbachev's Sinatra
Doctrine, unlike the Brezhnev Doctrine's iron-fisted control, represented a radical philosophical
shift toward sovereignty, as seen in Poland's Solidarity success; this not only emboldened East
German demonstrators but arguably accelerated the Soviet Union's own dissolution, revealing the
interconnected fragility of the Eastern Bloc.' This achieves the top level through original insight
into long-term consequences, fostering deep engagement that elevates the essay beyond description to
thoughtful critique.

language_style_mechanics — Language, Style, and Mechanics
Level: Readable but with noticeable errors in grammar, style, or mechanics that affect clarity. (2)    Score: 2
Description:
Reviews the clarity, precision, and error-free quality of the writing.
Examples:
Excerpt:
The Wall was originally built in 1961 under Soviet leader Nikita Khruschchev, however when Mikhail
Gorbachev was elected General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1985, the
whole perspective of the Wall changed.
  Comment:
This sentence is readable but contains a spelling error ('Khruschchev' should be 'Khrushchev') and a
run-on structure without proper punctuation, slightly affecting clarity and professionalism.
Excerpt:
Such aspects of free-market capitalism had not been seen in the Soviet Union since the brief New
Economic Policy of Vladimir Lenin, instituted in 1922 after the Russian civil war (“Glasnost”).
  Comment:
The phrasing is mostly clear, but inconsistent citation placement and minor stylistic awkwardness
(e.g., abrupt historical jump) make it noticeable, impacting the overall polish without fully
hindering comprehension.
Improvement Suggestion:
Target the top level of polished, engaging prose with precise language, varied sentences, and no
errors by proofreading thoroughly and varying sentence structure for rhythm. For example, revise the
misspelled sentence to: 'Erected in 1961 under Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the Berlin Wall
symbolized division; yet, with Mikhail Gorbachev's ascension to General Secretary in 1985, its
ideological foundations began to crumble amid his reformist agenda.' This secures the highest level
by eliminating errors, employing precise vocabulary like 'ascension' and 'crumble' for engagement,
and using varied syntax to enhance readability and stylistic flair.
