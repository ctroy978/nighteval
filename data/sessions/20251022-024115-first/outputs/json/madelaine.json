  "summary": "The essay demonstrates a clear structure and adequate use of evidence to support its claim about the origin of Chronic Wasting Disease, showing solid organization and development. However, it lacks deeper critical analysis and has noticeable issues with language and mechanics that affect polish. To improve, focus on providing original insights and refining grammar and formatting for greater clarity and engagement.",

      "improvement_suggestion": "To reach the top level where the thesis is clear, insightful, and effectively guides the entire essay with a strong, original argument, revise your thesis to incorporate a unique angle, such as potential ecological implications of this evolution. For example: 'Beyond mere similarities, the evolutionary adaptation of TSE prions to cervid biology, driven by shared habitats with livestock, positions it as the primary origin of CWD, with profound implications for wildlife management.' This change earns the top level by adding originality and insight, making the argument more compelling and directly tying to broader impacts for seamless guidance throughout the essay."
