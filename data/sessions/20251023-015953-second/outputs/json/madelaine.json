  "summary": "The essay presents a clear argument about the origin of Chronic Wasting Disease from TSE, with solid organization and adequate support from sources, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. Strengths include logical progression and relevant evidence, but improvements are needed in deepening the critical analysis and polishing language mechanics to eliminate noticeable errors. Overall, it effectively addresses the prompt but could benefit from more original insights and precise writing.",

      "improvement_suggestion": "To reach the top level of a clear, insightful thesis that effectively guides the essay with a strong, original argument, refine your statement to incorporate unique insights, such as potential ecological implications. For example, revise to: 'Given the prion-based similarities in transmission, neurological effects, and symptoms, CWD likely originated from TSE through natural adaptation in shared habitats, posing risks to wildlife management.' This earns the highest level by adding originality and depth, ensuring the thesis not only states the connection but also hints at broader impacts for a more guiding and insightful framework."

For instance, instead of 'Alongside the many ways,' use: 'Building on these transmission parallels, the neurological impacts of TSE further mirror those of CWD, as both involve prion misfolding that leads to brain degeneration.' This change achieves the highest level by creating seamless idea progression, eliminating any sense of disjointedness and elevating the overall coherence through precise, engaging links."

For example, revise the pasture example to: 'For instance, USGS reports document prions persisting in soil for years, allowing deer to ingest contaminated grass from livestock waste, as observed in Colorado outbreaks (U.S. Geological Survey, 2023).' This secures the top level by integrating detailed, source-specific evidence that not only supports but also strengthens the argument through vivid, authoritative reinforcement."
