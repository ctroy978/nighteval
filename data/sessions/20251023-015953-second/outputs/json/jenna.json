  "summary": "The essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the historical context and effectively uses evidence to support its main points, with a clear structure that guides the reader through the argument. However, it could benefit from deeper critical analysis to provide original insights and from polishing language and mechanics to eliminate noticeable errors that occasionally disrupt clarity. Overall, focusing on more insightful interpretation and error-free prose would elevate the work to a higher level.",

For example, revise to: 'Gorbachev's allowance of the Berlin Wall's fall stemmed from his visionary reforms, which, while aiming to revitalize socialism, paradoxically sowed the seeds for the Eastern Bloc's unraveling.' This change earns the top level by introducing originality and deeper insight, ensuring the thesis actively shapes a compelling, unified essay."
