Criteria:
thesis_argument — Thesis and Argument
Level: 3: Thesis is clear and focused, with a solid argument that adequately addresses the prompt.    Score: 3
Description:
Evaluates the clarity, insight, and guidance provided by the thesis in addressing the prompt.
Examples:
Excerpt:
Despite logistical hurdles, "The Line" stands as a visionary urban experiment and an ideal place to
live due to its pioneering sustainability features, innovative urban design, and focus on enhancing
residents’ quality of life.
  Comment:
This thesis clearly outlines the main reasons why 'The Line' is ideal, providing a focused structure
that guides the essay's discussion on sustainability, design, and quality of life, though it
Excerpt:
In conclusion, "The Line" represents a bold and innovative approach to urban development that
addresses many of the challenges modern cities face.
  Comment:
The conclusion reinforces the thesis by summarizing key points, maintaining relevance to the prompt,
but remains somewhat general without deeper originality.
Improvement Suggestion:
To reach the top level of a clear, insightful thesis that effectively guides the essay with a
strong, original argument, revise your thesis to incorporate a unique perspective, such as how 'The
Line' could influence global urban policy beyond Saudi Arabia. For example: 'Despite logistical
hurdles, "The Line" not only pioneers sustainability and design but also sets a transformative
blueprint for reimagining urban policy worldwide, making it an ideal haven for future generations.'
This change earns the top level by adding originality and insight, ensuring the thesis drives a more
compelling, forward-looking argument throughout.

organization_coherence — Organization and Coherence
Level: 3: Clear structure with effective transitions; ideas flow logically overall.    Score: 3
Description:
Assesses the structure, transitions, and logical flow of ideas.
Examples:
Excerpt:
One of the most compelling aspects of "The Line" is its commitment to sustainability. The city is
designed to run entirely on renewable energy... This aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 11...
  Comment:
This paragraph transitions smoothly from the introduction of sustainability to specific features and
global alignment, maintaining logical progression, though some later sections repeat ideas like
walkability.
Excerpt:
"The Line" revolutionizes urban design by eliminating cars and roads... This project is designed to
integrate nature seamlessly into urban living...
  Comment:
The shift from design to nature integration uses connecting phrases effectively, ensuring overall
coherence, but could be more seamless to avoid minor repetition.
Improvement Suggestion:
Aim for the highest level by creating an exceptionally well-organized essay with seamless
transitions and a coherent progression of ideas; for instance, use transitional phrases that build
cumulatively, like 'Building on this sustainable foundation, the innovative design further
enhances...' instead of starting new paragraphs abruptly. This revision would earn top marks by
eliminating any sense of disjointedness, allowing ideas to flow as a unified narrative that
progressively strengthens the argument.

development_support — Development and Support
Level: 4: Rich, relevant evidence from credible sources, integrated smoothly to strongly support the argument.    Score: 4
Description:
Examines the use of evidence and examples to support the argument.
Examples:
Excerpt:
Regular walking reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, and
improves mental health by reducing stress and increasing happiness (CNUWalkable).
  Comment:
This integrates a credible source smoothly to support health benefits, providing rich evidence that
directly bolsters the argument on walkability's impact.
Excerpt:
According to the American Thoracic Society, reducing air pollution can lead to rapid health
improvements, including decreased respiratory symptoms and lower rates of cardiovascular illness
within weeks (ATSAirPollution).
  Comment:
The citation of a specific study enhances support for the zero-pollution claim, demonstrating
strong, relevant evidence that ties environmental design to tangible health outcomes.
Improvement Suggestion:
You've already achieved strong development, but to consistently hit the top level of rich, relevant
evidence integrated smoothly, ensure every claim links back explicitly to the thesis with varied
source types; for example, expand a point with: 'As evidenced by NEOM's projections and corroborated
by UN SDG 11, this 95% land preservation not only minimizes sprawl but redefines biodiversity
protection in urban contexts.' This would solidify top-level status by deepening integration and
showing multifaceted support that powerfully reinforces originality.

critical_analysis — Critical Analysis and Understanding
Level: 3: Solid analysis with clear interpretation and appropriate engagement with the topic.    Score: 3
Description:
Evaluates the depth of analysis and engagement with the topic.
Examples:
Excerpt:
This aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11, which strives to make cities
inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable (UNSDGCities).
  Comment:
This shows clear interpretation by linking the project's features to global goals, demonstrating
appropriate engagement, though it could delve deeper into potential implications.
Excerpt:
Smart cities like "The Line" use technology to optimize services and improve the lives of residents
by providing efficient transportation, energy management, and public services
(PlanteMoranSmartCities).
  Comment:
The analysis interprets technology's role effectively, engaging with the topic solidly, but remains
somewhat surface-level without exploring unique challenges or innovations.
Improvement Suggestion:
To attain the top level of sophisticated analysis with original insights and deep engagement,
incorporate critical evaluation of counterarguments or future implications; revise a section like:
'While "The Line's" cognitive technologies promise personalized services, they must navigate privacy
concerns innovatively, as seen in potential AI ethics frameworks, to truly elevate urban well-being
beyond current smart city models.' This earns the highest mark by adding original depth,
transforming description into insightful critique that engages profoundly with the material.

This opening sentence uses clear, engaging language to set the context effectively, with precise
word choice that draws the reader in without distraction.
Excerpt:
The integration of nature and technology allows for a harmonious living environment where residents
can enjoy both the benefits of modern amenities and the tranquility of natural surroundings.
  Comment:
The prose is effective and readable here, conveying ideas smoothly, though minor spacing issues in
citations elsewhere do not significantly impede understanding.
Improvement Suggestion:
Strive for the pinnacle of polished, engaging prose with precise language, varied sentences, and no
errors by varying sentence structure and eliminating any formatting inconsistencies; for instance,
refine: 'Residents will thrive in a seamless blend of cutting-edge tech and verdant escapes,
fostering not just survival but profound harmony with the environment.' This adjustment secures the

captivating and professional.
