Overall Score: 14/20 (14 / 20)
Summary:
The essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the historical context and effectively uses evidence
to support its main points, with a clear structure that guides the reader through the argument.
However, it could benefit from deeper critical analysis to provide original insights and from
polishing language and mechanics to eliminate noticeable errors that occasionally disrupt clarity.
Overall, focusing on more insightful interpretation and error-free prose would elevate the work to a
higher level.

Criteria:
thesis_argument — Thesis and Argument
Level: Thesis is clear and focused, with a solid argument that adequately addresses the prompt.    Score: 3
Description:
Evaluates the clarity, insight, and guidance provided by the thesis and the strength of the overall
argument.
Examples:
Excerpt:
Gorbachev allowed for the Berlin wall to be taken down because he sought a greater purpose for the
Soviet Union made possible by a socialist system with a more innovative approach.
  Comment:
This excerpt presents a clear thesis that outlines the main reasons for Gorbachev's decision,
focusing on his vision for reform, which adequately addresses the implied prompt without lacking
relevance.
Excerpt:
In conclusion, the Soviet leader allowed the Berlin wall to come down because he had a broader
vision for the Soviet Union and its role in the world.
  Comment:
The concluding restatement reinforces the thesis effectively, maintaining focus on the key
arguments, though it could be more insightful to reach higher levels.
Improvement Suggestion:
To achieve the top level of a clear, insightful thesis that guides the essay with a strong, original
argument, refine your thesis to include a unique perspective, such as how Gorbachev's reforms not
only enabled the Wall's fall but also inadvertently accelerated the Soviet Union's own dissolution.
For example, revise to: 'Gorbachev's allowance of the Berlin Wall's fall stemmed from his visionary
reforms, which, while aiming to revitalize socialism, paradoxically sowed the seeds for the Eastern
Bloc's unraveling.' This change earns the top level by introducing originality and deeper insight,
ensuring the thesis actively shapes a compelling, unified essay.

organization_coherence — Organization and Coherence
Level: Clear structure with effective transitions; ideas flow logically overall.    Score: 3
Description:
Assesses the structure, transitions, and logical flow of ideas throughout the essay.
Examples:
Excerpt:
Gorbachev allowed for the Berlin wall to be taken down because he sought a greater purpose for the
Soviet Union made possible by a socialist system with a more innovative approach. Perestroika was
Gorbachev’s policy introduced in 1985...
  Comment:
This transition from the thesis to the first body paragraph on Perestroika maintains logical
progression, effectively linking the broader argument to specific evidence.
Excerpt:
However, these reforms placed other considerations on the economy for Mikhail Gorbachev. The Soviet
leader’s recognition of the Union’s dire need for internal economic recovery shifted concern away
from the Berlin Wall.
  Comment:
The use of 'However' here signals a shift to the next reason, supporting overall coherence by
connecting economic priorities to the Wall's fate, though some sections could flow more seamlessly.
Improvement Suggestion:
Aim for the highest level by creating an exceptionally well-organized essay with seamless
transitions and coherent progression, such as using varied transitional phrases that explicitly tie
evidence back to the thesis. For instance, instead of 'However, these reforms placed other
considerations...,' revise to: 'Building on perestroika's domestic focus, Gorbachev's recognition of
the Union's dire economic needs further diverted attention from maintaining the Wall, prioritizing
recovery over repression.' This revision earns top marks by enhancing seamlessness and ensuring
every section advances the argument fluidly, fostering a cohesive narrative.

development_support — Development and Support
Level: Adequate evidence and examples that effectively support main points.    Score: 3
Description:
Examines the use of evidence, examples, and integration to support the main points.
Examples:
Excerpt:
Perestroika was Gorbachev’s policy introduced in 1985 to reform the Soviet Union’s stagnant economy
and political system. Gorbachev’s perestroika program loosened centralized control of many
businesses... (“Perestroika”).
  Comment:
This excerpt provides adequate historical evidence from a cited source to support the argument on
economic reform, effectively illustrating how perestroika contributed to the Wall's fall.
Excerpt:
The Sinatra Doctrine a policy allowing neighboring Warsaw Pact countries to resolve their internal
affairs... As a result, democratic reforms were enabled across the Eastern Bloc. One of the most
notable was Poland’s Solidarity movement... (“Sinatra Doctrine”).
  Comment:
Citing specific examples like the Solidarity movement bolsters the point on non-intervention,
offering relevant support that ties directly to the escalation of East German protests.
Improvement Suggestion:
To reach the top tier with rich, relevant evidence from credible sources integrated smoothly to
strongly support the argument, expand citations with brief analysis of their implications and ensure
seamless weaving into your prose. For example, revise the Perestroika section to: 'As detailed in
historical accounts, perestroika not only loosened controls but unleashed market forces that
destabilized the command economy, indirectly eroding the Wall's justification by highlighting
socialism's adaptability over rigidity ("Perestroika"). This integration earns the highest level by
transforming evidence into a powerful reinforcement of your thesis, demonstrating sophisticated use
of sources.

critical_analysis — Critical Analysis and Understanding
Level: Solid analysis with clear interpretation and appropriate engagement with the topic.    Score: 3
Description:
Evaluates the depth of analysis, insights, and engagement with the topic.
Examples:
Excerpt:
These policies show that Gorbachev was striving for a more dynamic socialist system because the
policies he installed paved the way for East Germans to demand reforms and protest to have the
Berlin Wall removed.
  Comment:
This sentence offers solid interpretation by linking glasnost and perestroika to the protests,
showing appropriate engagement with how reforms enabled change.
Excerpt:
This shift reflected Gorbachev’s practical vision to modernize the Soviet Union, prioritizing
economic survival over imperial control. Ultimately, that enabled the Wall’s fall on November 9,
1989.
  Comment:
The analysis here clearly interprets Gorbachev's priorities, connecting economic needs to
non-intervention, which demonstrates engagement but lacks deeper originality.
Improvement Suggestion:
Strive for sophisticated analysis with original insights and deep engagement by exploring
counterarguments or broader implications, such as the ironic role of reforms in hastening
communism's end. Revise the economic recovery section to: 'Gorbachev's pivot to economic survival,
while pragmatic, ironically amplified the Wall's obsolescence, as perestroika's failures exposed the
regime's fragility, inviting the very protests it sought to avoid.' This earns the top level through
original insight that critically engages the material, revealing nuanced understanding beyond
surface-level description.

language_style_mechanics — Language, Style, and Mechanics
Level: Readable but with noticeable errors in grammar, style, or mechanics that affect clarity.    Score: 2
Description:
Reviews the clarity, precision, variety, and error-free quality of the writing.
Examples:
Excerpt:
The wall divided families and communities, and was inherently controlling, as its primary purpose
was to restrict and regulate the movement of East Germans.
  Comment:
This sentence is readable and conveys the idea clearly, but minor spacing issues and repetitive
phrasing slightly affect the overall polish.
Excerpt:
Gorbachev’ s ideology was unexpected given the historical conflict of the Soviet Union (“Mikhail
Gorbachev”). Ultimately , as time went on, the Soviet leader allowed the Berlin wall to come
  Comment:
Noticeable errors like inconsistent capitalization ('soviet'), awkward phrasing, and incomplete
sentences hinder comprehension and disrupt the flow.
Improvement Suggestion:
Target polished, engaging prose with precise language, varied sentences, and no errors by
proofreading for spacing, spelling, and consistency, then varying sentence structure for engagement.
For example, revise the incomplete sentence to: 'Gorbachev's ideology, surprisingly progressive amid
the Soviet Union's history of conflict, ultimately led him to permit the Berlin Wall's dismantling
as reforms progressed.' This change achieves the top level by eliminating errors, enhancing
precision and variety, and creating engaging, error-free writing that captivates the reader.
