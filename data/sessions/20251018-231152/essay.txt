Nuclear
 
Power
 
Is
 
Not
 
the
 
Solution
 
Nuclear
 
power
 
has
 
been
 
hailed
 
as
 
the
 
solution
 
to
 
all
 
of
 
our
 
modern
 
day
 
energy
 
problems.
 
Advocates
 
claim
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
clean,
 
safe,
 
and
 
cost
 
effective.
 
However ,
 
accidents
 
like
 
the
 
one
 
at
 
Chernobyl
 
have
 
forced
 
us
 
to
 
take
 
a
 
hard
 
and
 
thorough
 
look
 
at
 
the
 
minefield
 
of
 
nuclear
 
power .
 
After
 
studying
 
the
 
mountains
 
of
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
subject,
 
it
 
is
 
easy
 
to
 
come
 
to
 
the
 
conclusion
 
that
 
nuclear
 
power
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
good
 
source
 
for
 
future
 
energy.
 
Nuclear
 
fission
 
is
 
a
 
poor
 
choice
 
for
 
energy
 
because
 
it
 
is
 
dangerous,
 
expensive,
 
and
 
can
 
easily
 
be
 
replaced
 
by
 
true
 
renewable
 
resources.
         
 
 
First
 
it
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
understand
 
how
 
nuclear
 
energy
 
really
 
works.
 
The
 
underlying
 
principle
 
of
 
a
 
reactor
 
is
 
called
 
nuclear
 
fission,
 
which
 
is
 
when
 
an
 
atom’ s
 
nucleus
 
is
 
broken
 
into
 
smaller
 
pieces,
 
releasing
 
large
 
amounts
 
of
 
energy
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
heat
 
(pringle
 
9).
 
The
 
broken
 
nucleus
 
sends
 
out
 
more
 
neutrons,
 
which
 
collide
 
with
 
more
 
atoms,
 
resulting
 
in
 
a
 
chain
 
reaction.
 
The
 
core
 
of
 
the
 
reactor
 
is
 
made
 
up
 
of
 
fuel
 
rods
 
and
 
control
 
rods.
 
The
 
fuel
 
rods
 
contain
 
pellets
 
of
 
uranium
 
that
 
produce
 
vast
 
amount
 
of
 
heat,
 
while
 
the
 
control
 
rods
 
absorb
 
neutrons
 
and
 
are
 
lowered
 
to
 
stop
 
the
 
nuclear
 
reaction.
 
The
 
reactor
 
heats
 
water
 
until
 
it
 
produces
 
steam,
 
which
 
then
 
turns
 
a
 
generator
 
to
 
produce
 
electricity
 
(pringle
 
11).
 
A
 
coolant
 
substance,
 
usually
 
water ,
 
is
 
cycled
 
through
 
the
 
reactor
 
in
 
a
 
loop
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
reactor
 
cool.
 
If
 
the
 
fuel
 
rods
 
become
 
too
 
hot
 
they
 
will
 
catch
 
fire
 
and
 
melt,
 
which
 
is
 
known
 
as
 
a
 
nuclear
 
meltdown.
 
Many
 
people
 
have
 
been
 
told
 
that
 
nuclear
 
power
 
is
 
practically
 
foolproof.
 
However ,
 
the
 
nuclear

industry
 
does
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
strong
 
record
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
telling
 
the
 
truth.
 
The
 
AEC,
 
or
 
Atomic
 
Energy
 
Commission,
 
was
 
created
 
to
 
moderate
 
nuclear
 
materials
 
and
 
development.
 
The
 
deception
 
began
 
when
 
the
 
AEC
 
assured
 
the
 
public
 
that
 
radiation
 
from
 
nuclear
 
testing
 
was
 
relatively
 
harmless
 
which,
 
as
 
we
 
know
 
today ,
 
is
 
completely
 
untrue
 
(pringle
 
5).
 
What
 
followed
 
was
 
a
 
series
 
of
 
deceptions
 
and
 
cover -ups
 
by
 
the
 
AEC.
 
For
 
many
 
years
 
no
 
one
 
knew
 
the
 
truth
 
about
 
nuclear
 
energy
 
until
 
the
 
freedom
 
of
 
information
 
act
 
was
 
passed
 
in
 
1973.
 
Afterwards
 
they
 
were
 
required
 
to
 
release
 
a
 
large
 
amount
 
of
 
documents
 
containing
 
reports
 
of
 
incidents
 
within
 
plants
 
across
 
the
 
nation
 
(pringle
 
28.)
 
One
 
such
 
file
 
even
 
described
 
how
 
a
 
vat
 
of
 
toxic
 
waste
 
was
 
connected
 
to
 
a
 
plants
 
drinking
 
water
 
supply
 
(pringle
 
28).
 
No
 
matter
 
what
 
the
 
nuclear
 
industry
 
tells
 
us,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
mountain
 
of
 
evidence
 
proving
 
that
 
nuclear
 
energy
 
is
 
not
 
nearly
 
as
 
safe
 
as
 
it
 
is
 
made
 
out
 
to
 
be.
 
 
Naturally ,
 
most
 
people
 
associate
 
the
 
word
 
“nuclear”
 
with
 
“bomb.”
 
While
 
a
 
nuclear
 
reactor
 
could
 
not
 
explode
 
like
 
an
 
atomic
 
bomb,
 
there
 
are
 
many
 
dangers
 
that
 
come
 
with
 
the
 
territory .
 
Of
 
all
 
the
 
accidents
 
that
 
can
 
occur ,
 
a
 
loss
 
of
 
coolant
 
accident
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
feared
 
(pringle
 
20).
 
This
 
catastrophe
 
is
 
exactly
 
as
 
the
 
name
 
suggests;
 
it’s
 
what
 
would
 
happen
 
if
 
for
 
any
 
reason
 
a
 
reactor
 
lost
 
its
 
coolant
 
and
 
there
 
was
 
no
 
way
 
to
 
replace
 
it.
 
The
 
first
 
step
 
if
 
this
 
sort
 
of
 
reaction
 
were
 
to
 
occur
 
would
 
be
 
to
 
lower
 
the
 
control
 
rods
 
and
 
completely
 
stop
 
the
 
nuclear
 
chain
 
reaction.
 
This
 
would
 
not
 
solve
 
the
 
problem
 
at
 
hand,
 
because
 
the
 
fuel
 
rods
 
still
 
produce
 
heat
 
naturally ,
 
reaching
 
4,000
 
degrees
 
Fahrenheit
 
in
 
just
 
a
 
small
 
amount
 
of
 
time
 
(pringle
 
20).
 
A
 
little
 
while
 
after
 
that
 
the
 
fuel
 
rods
 
would
 
melt
 
and
 
become
 
a
 
mass
 
of
 
molten
 
radioactive
 
material.
 
This
 
mass
 
would
 
burn
 
its
 
way
 
through
 
the
 
reactor
 
encasement
 
and
 
into
 
the
 
ground,
 
where
 
it
 
would
 
release
 
tons
 
of
 
radioactive
 
steam
 
into
 
the
 
atmosphere.
 
According
 
to
 
a
 
study
 
conducted
 
in
 
1964,
 
an
 
accident
 
like

this
 
would
 
result
 
in
 
around
 
45,000
 
deaths,
 
100,000
 
injuries,
 
and
 
17
 
billion
 
dollars
 
of
 
property
 
damage
 
over
 
an
 
area
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
Pennsylvania
 
(pringle
 
21).
 
Imagine
 
how
 
much
 
greater
 
these
 
numbers
 
would
 
be
 
in
 
modern
 
times
 
with
 
bigger ,
 
and
 
more
 
dangerous,
 
nuclear
 
reactors.
 
One
 
of
 
the
 
biggest
 
anti-nuclear
 
arguments
 
other
 
than
 
safety
 
is
 
the
 
issue
 
of
 
nuclear
 
waste.
 
High
 
level
 
waste
 
is
 
generated
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
spent
 
uranium
 
fuel
 
rods
 
that
 
can
 
no
 
longer
 
sustain
 
a
 
reaction,
 
and
 
is
 
extremely
 
radioactive
 
(Radioactive).
 
Waste
 
like
 
this
 
can
 
stay
 
dangerously
 
radioactive
 
anywhere
 
from
 
ten
 
thousand
 
to
 
more
 
than
 
a
 
million
 
years
 
(Radioactive).
 
Today
 
most
 
of
 
this
 
waste
 
is
 
kept
 
in
 
pools
 
of
 
water
 
called
 
spent
 
fuel
 
pools,
 
until
 
some
 
agreement
 
is
 
reached
 
about
 
what
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
all
 
of
 
it.
 
With
 
more
 
than
 
63,000
 
tons
 
of
 
nuclear
 
waste
 
existing
 
in
 
the
 
US,
 
and
 
more
 
being
 
generated
 
every
 
day,
 
we
 
will
 
soon
 
run
 
out
 
of
 
places
 
to
 
put
 
it
 
(Hargreaves).
 
The
 
waste
 
will
 
be
 
stored
 
closer
 
and
 
closer
 
to
 
urban
 
populations,
 
causing
 
health
 
risks
 
for
 
the
 
citizens
 
who
 
live
 
there.
 
The
 
more
 
spent
 
fuel
 
there
 
is
 
just
 
lying
 
around,
 
the
 
greater
 
the
 
chance
 
for
 
an
 
accident
 
to
 
occur .
 
 
The
 
biggest
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
nuclear
 
energy
 
cycle
 
that
 
is
 
at
 
risk
 
for
 
attack
 
is
 
spent
 
nuclear
 
fuel.
 
Nuclear
 
reactors
 
have
 
a
 
50
 
mile
 
fallout
 
zone,
 
which
 
the
 
major
 
cities
 
of
 
Washington,
 
Boston,
 
New
 
York,
 
Philadelphia,
 
and
 
Chicago
 
all
 
happen
 
to
 
occupy
 
(Hargreaves).
 
All
 
of
 
the
 
spent
 
fuel
 
pools
 
in
 
every
 
reactor
 
are
 
vulnerable
 
to
 
sabotage.
 
A
 
fuel
 
pool
 
consists
 
of
 
spent
 
rods
 
collected
 
in
 
a
 
deep
 
pool
 
of
 
water ,
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
only
 
thing
 
that
 
keeps
 
them
 
from
 
overheating.
 
If
 
the
 
water
 
was
 
somehow
 
removed
 
from
 
the
 
pool,
 
the
 
uranium
 
rods
 
would
 
burst
 
into
 
flame
 
and
 
melt,
 
causing
 
“an
 
area
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
half
 
of
 
New
 
Jersey
 
to
 
become
 
permanently
 
uninhabitable”
 
(Hargreaves).
  
Some
 
of
 
the
 
reactors
 
in
 
the
 
US
 
store
 
their
 
spent
 
fuel
 
above
 
ground,
 
which
 
makes
 
them
 
vulnerable
 
to
 
attacks
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
plane
 
crash,
 
like
 
the
 
one
 
that
 
occurred
 
on
 
9/11
 
(Hargreaves).

Very
 
few
 
new
 
nuclear
 
plants
 
are
 
being
 
built
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
significant
 
costs
 
involved
 
in
 
producing
 
energy.
 
One
 
of
 
the
 
largest
 
costs
 
within
 
the
 
nuclear
 
cycle
 
is
 
building
 
the
 
plant
 
itself.
 
The
 
price
 
tag
 
on
 
a
 
nuclear
 
reactor
 
has
 
varied
 
throughout
 
the
 
years.
 
In
 
2008
 
the
 
Geor gia
 
Power
 
Company
 
agreed
 
to
 
build
 
two
 
nuclear
 
reactors
 
for
 
a
 
total
 
price
 
of
 
about
 
17
 
billion
 
dollars
 
(Economics).
 
The
 
only
 
nuclear
 
plant
 
that
 
was
 
built
 
in
 
Oregon
 
cost
 
450
 
million
 
dollars
 
to
 
construct,
 
which
 
many
 
considered
 
a
 
waste
 
as
 
it
 
was
 
destroyed
 
about
 
30
 
years
 
later
 
due
 
to
 
safety
 
reasons
 
(Trojan).
 
On
 
the
 
opposite
 
side
 
of
 
the
 
energy
 
cycle,
 
it
 
costs
 
a
 
large
 
amount
 
of
 
money
 
to
 
decommission
 
a
 
nuclear
 
plant
 
as
 
well.
 
Most
 
nuclear
 
plants
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
shut
 
down
 
after
 
60
 
years
 
of
 
operation
 
(Economics).
 
It
 
can
 
cost
 
upwards
 
of
 
300
 
million
 
dollars
 
to
 
destroy
 
a
 
nuclear
 
plant,
 
which
 
in
 
some
 
reactors
 
is
 
more
 
expensive
 
than
 
building
 
the
 
plant
 
itself
 
(Economics).
 
There
 
is
 
also
 
a
 
significant
 
price
 
tag
 
involved
 
in
 
disposing
 
and
 
storing
 
of
 
nuclear
 
waste.
 
In
 
Britain,
 
it
 
cost
 
up
 
to
 
about
 
308,000
 
US
 
dollars
 
per
 
cubic
 
meter
 
to
 
dispose
 
of
 
high
 
level
 
waste
 
(Economics).
 
Extra
 
precautions
 
must
 
be
 
taken
 
to
 
shield
 
the
 
average
 
citizen
 
from
 
harmful
 
radiation.
 
Whether
 
by
 
train
 
or
 
truck,
 
the
 
waste
 
must
 
be
 
constantly
 
guarded
 
against
 
potential
 
terrorist
 
attacks.
 
There
 
are
 
costs
 
involved
 
in
 
building
 
and
 
maintaining
 
the
 
many
 
spent
 
fuel
 
pools
 
in
 
plants
 
around
 
the
 
country
 
(Economics).
 
Without
 
a
 
permanent
 
storage
 
facility ,
 
which
 
will
 
also
 
cost
 
money
 
to
 
construct,
 
more
 
pools
 
will
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
built,
 
and
 
more
 
money
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
spent.
 
In
 
all
 
aspects
 
of
 
the
 
nuclear
 
industry ,
 
extra
 
safety
 
means
 
extra
 
money .
 
As
 
the
 
public
 
has
 
begun
 
to
 
realize
 
the
 
dangers
 
of
 
nuclear
 
power ,
 
energy
 
companies
 
have
 
to
 
spend
 
more
 
money
 
to
 
convince
 
people
 
of
 
its
 
reliability .
 
More
 
guards
 
to
 
protect
 
waste,
 
reinforced
 
concrete
 
to
 
protect
 
against
 
earthquakes,
 
and
 
more
 
sophisticated
 
security
 
measures
 
all
 
lead
 
to
 
more
 
government
 
money
 
being
 
spent
 
(Economics).
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
huge
 
cost
 
to
 
be
 
considered
 
when

all
 
that
 
safety
 
fails.
 
It
 
can
 
cost
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
government
 
money
 
to
 
clean
 
up
 
a
 
nuclear
 
accident.
 
Nuclear
 
accidents
 
like
 
the
 
one
 
at
 
Chernobyl
 
also
 
make
 
people
 
less
 
likely
 
to
 
welcome
 
a
 
reactor
 
into
 
their
 
neighborhood,
 
making
 
it
 
more
 
difficult
 
and
 
expensive
 
to
 
find
 
potential
 
plant
 
sites
 
(Economics).
 
       
 
Nuclear
 
reactors
 
can
 
easily
 
be
 
replaced
 
by
 
true
 
renewable
 
energy
 
sources.
 
The
 
Fukushima
 
nuclear
 
disaster
 
of
 
2011
 
took
 
out
 
11
 
of
 
japans
 
nuclear
 
reactors,
 
while
 
no
 
damage
 
was
 
caused
 
to
 
the
 
nations
 
several
 
wind
 
farms
 
(Thomas).
 
Obviously ,
 
renewable
 
energy
 
is
 
much
 
safer
 
than
 
nuclear
 
power .
 
Solar
 
farms
 
can’t
 
cause
 
radiation
 
sickness,
 
wind
 
farms
 
won’ t
 
melt
 
and
 
cause
 
irreparable
 
environmental
 
damage,
 
and
 
hydroelectric
 
power
 
doesn’ t
 
produce
 
radioactive
 
waste.
 
Experts
 
may
 
claim
 
that
 
nuclear
 
power
 
is
 
more
 
a
 
more
 
reliable
 
source
 
of
 
energy.
 
The
 
problem
 
with
 
this
 
statement
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
wind
 
will
 
always
 
blow
 
and
 
the
 
sun
 
will
 
always
 
shine.
 
We
 
just
 
haven’ t
 
invested
 
enough
 
money
 
to
 
truly
 
tap
 
into
 
the
 
huge
 
amounts
 
of
 
energy
 
available.
 
       
 
Renewable
 
energy
 
is
 
also
 
much
 
easier
 
to
 
produce
 
than
 
nuclear
 
power .
 
Nuclear
 
plants
 
can
 
take
 
more
 
than
 
a
 
decade
 
to
 
complete,
 
and
 
have
 
a
 
history
 
of
 
construction
 
delays
 
(Thomas).
 
By
 
comparison,
 
small
 
wind
 
farms
 
can
 
be
 
built
 
in
 
just
 
a
 
few
 
months,
 
and
 
larger
 
farms
 
are
 
completed
 
in
 
less
 
than
 
a
 
year.
 
Solar
 
farms
 
are
 
typically
 
completed
 
within
 
a
 
few
 
months
 
(What.)
 
If
 
more
 
money
 
was
 
invested
 
into
 
renewable
 
energy,
 
and
 
more
 
conservative
 
energy
 
practices
 
were
 
used,
 
renewable
 
energy
 
could
 
easily
 
overcome
 
the
 
electricity
 
produced
 
by
 
nuclear
 
power
 
(Thomas).
 
In
 
2011,
 
the
 
US
 
invested
 
about
 
50
 
billion
 
dollars
 
in
 
renewable
 
energy
 
sources
 
(Macguire).
 
While
 
this
 
is
 
an
 
impressive
 
number ,
 
compare
 
it
 
to
 
the
 
64
 
nuclear
 
plants
 
in
 
the
 
US,
 
some
 
costing
 
more
 
than
 
10
 
billion
 
to
 
build,
 
plus
 
insurance
 
and
 
maintenance
 
cost
 
(Economics).
 
If
 
all
 
the
 
money
 
that
 
is
 
being
 
spent
 
on
 
nuclear
 
energy
 
was
 
funneled
 
into
 
renewable
 
energy,
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
electricity
 
produced
 
would
 
be
 
more
 
than
 
enough
 
to
 
compensate
 
for
 
the
 
loss
 
of
 
nuclear .

One
 
of
 
the
 
arguments
 
promoting
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
nuclear
 
power
 
is
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
promising
 
renewable
 
resources.
 
There's
 
one
 
big
 
problem
 
with
 
this
 
statement,
 
which
 
is
 
that
 
nuclear
 
energy
 
is
 
not
 
actually
 
renewable.
 
In
 
the
 
process
 
of
 
creating
 
energy
 
uranium
 
is
 
used
 
up,
 
and
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
finite
 
supply
 
of
 
uranium
 
in
 
the
 
world,
 
which
 
makes
 
nuclear
 
energy
 
completely
 
non-renewable.
 
Nuclear
 
waste
 
can
 
be
 
reprocessed
 
to
 
produce
 
more
 
usable
 
uranium,
 
but
 
very
 
few
 
power
 
companies
 
choose
 
to
 
do
 
this
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
large
 
cost
 
and
 
little
 
benefit
 
(pringle
 
85.)
 
Advocates
 
of
 
nuclear
 
energy
 
like
 
to
 
insist
 
that
 
reactors
 
cannot
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
create
 
nuclear
 
weapons.
 
While
 
the
 
reactors
 
themselves
 
can’t
 
be
 
used
 
as
 
a
 
weapon,
 
the
 
spent
 
fuel
 
they
 
produce
 
can.
 
When
 
spent
 
fuel
 
is
 
reprocessed
 
it
 
can
 
produce
 
atoms
 
of
 
uranium-235
 
and
 
plutonium-239,
 
both
 
of
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
nuclear
 
weapon
 
(Nuclear).
 
Global
 
governments
 
have
 
realized
 
this
 
threat
 
and
 
stepped
 
up
 
their
 
security ,
 
but
 
in
 
this
 
case
 
it’s
 
not
 
enough.
 
Between
 
the
 
years
 
1980
 
and
 
1981,
 
the
 
US
 
government
 
found
 
that
 
55
 
pounds
 
of
 
plutonium
 
and
 
159
 
pounds
 
of
 
uranium
 
had
 
gone
 
missing
 
(Nuclear).
 
While
 
security
 
measures
 
have
 
evolved
 
since
 
then,
 
so
 
have
 
criminal
 
technologies,
 
and
 
it
 
is
 
perfectly
 
feasible
 
for
 
an
 
organization
 
to
 
steal
 
enough
 
radioactive
 
material
 
to
 
sell
 
to
 
rival
 
countries.
 
It
 
is
 
also
 
possible
 
for
 
a
 
country
 
to
 
open
 
a
 
power
 
plant
 
for
 
“peaceful”
 
intentions,
 
and
 
use
 
it
 
to
 
make
 
weapons-grade
 
uranium
 
instead.
 
A
 
good
 
example
 
of
 
this
 
is
 
North
 
Korea,
 
who
 
recently
 
announced
 
plans
 
to
 
reopen
 
their
 
decommissioned
 
nuclear
 
plant,
 
one
 
that
 
they
 
had
 
used
 
to
 
produce
 
6-8
 
bombs
 
worth
 
of
 
plutonium
 
(North).
 
Another
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
pro-nuclear
 
arguments
 
is
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
"clean"
 
source
 
of
 
energy.
 
In
 
fact,
 
the
 
American
 
Nuclear
 
Society
 
claims
 
that
 
"Nuclear
 
reactors
 
emit
 
no
 
gasses
 
during
 
operation”
 
(Top).
 
This
 
is
 
an
 
ingenious
 
way
 
to
 
put
 
it,
 
since
 
it’s
 
true;
 
however ,
 
there
 
are
 
large
 
amounts
 
of
 
CO2
 
involved
 
in
 
other
 
aspects
 
of
 
nuclear
 
energy.
 
It
 
takes
 
heavy
 
machinery
 
to
 
mine
 
and
 
transport

uranium
 
ore
 
by
 
truck
 
(Kimble).
 
In
 
a
 
refinery ,
 
uranium
 
ore
 
is
 
ground
 
into
 
dust,
 
treated
 
with
 
chemicals,
 
and
 
trucked
 
to
 
the
 
power
 
plant.
 
All
 
the
 
steps
 
of
 
refining
 
uranium
 
ore
 
require
 
the
 
release
 
of
 
carbon
 
dioxide
 
(Kimble).
 
There
 
is
 
also
 
carbon
 
released
 
in
 
vast
 
amounts
 
during
 
the
 
construction
 
of
 
a
 
nuclear
 
plant.
 
The
 
trains
 
and
 
trucks
 
that
 
transport
 
spent
 
nuclear
 
fuel
 
let
 
out
 
carbon
 
dioxide
 
into
 
the
 
atmosphere
 
as
 
well
 
(Kimble).
   
Nuclear
 
power
 
is
 
not
 
as
 
clean
 
of
 
an
 
energy
 
source
 
as
 
its
 
advocates
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
believe.
 
Many
 
people
 
of
 
the
 
modern
 
age
 
wish
 
to
 
see
 
a
 
“nuclear
 
comeback.”
 
It’s
 
obvious
 
after
 
even
 
just
 
a
 
little
 
research
 
that
 
a
 
nuclear
 
comeback
 
could
 
be
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
worst
 
things
 
for
 
the
 
US,
 
and
 
other
 
nations
 
around
 
the
 
world.
 
Nuclear
 
power
 
is
 
not
 
a
 
good
 
source
 
of
 
energy
 
for
 
the
 
future
 
because
 
it
 
is
 
dangerous,
 
expensive,
 
and
 
easily
 
replaced
 
by
 
other
 
clean
 
energy
 
sources.
 
It
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
much
 
better
 
idea
 
to
 
save
 
the
 
money
 
that
 
we
 
be
 
sucked
 
into
 
the
 
nuclear
 
energy
 
process
 
and
 
spend
 
it
 
on
 
cleaner
 
and
 
safer
 
renewable
 
energy.
 
People
 
often
 
say
 
that
 
if
 
mistakes
 
aren’ t
 
made,
 
there
 
is
 
no
 
way
 
to
 
learn
 
from
 
them.
 
If
 
that’s
 
true
 
then
 
it’s
 
time
 
to
 
learn
 
from
 
the
 
mistakes
 
of
 
Chernobyl
 
and
 
Fukushima,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
many
 
other
 
nuclear
 
accidents
 
that
 
have
 
occurred,
 
and
 
get
 
rid
 
of
 
nuclear
 
energy
 
for
 
good.
