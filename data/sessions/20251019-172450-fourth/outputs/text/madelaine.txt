Origin
 
of
 
Chronic
 
Wasting
 
Disease
 
 
Chronic
 
wasting
 
disease,
 
or
 
CWD,
 
is
 
a
 
neurological
 
degenerative
 
disease
 
that
 
affects
 
the
 
world’ s
 
cervid
 
population
 
(U.S.
 
Geological
 
Survey).
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
disease
 
that
 
causes
 
the
 
local
 
populations
 
of
 
elk,
 
deer,
 
reindeer ,
 
and
 
moose
 
to
 
die
 
slowly
 
over
 
a
 
few
 
years.
 
This
 
disease
 
appeared
 
in
 
1967
 
and
 
has
 
only
 
since
 
then
 
raised
 
a
 
multitude
 
of
 
questions.
 
Researchers
 
and
 
biologists
 
have
 
determined
 
what
 
causes
 
this
 
disease;
 
however ,
 
where
 
it
 
came
 
from
 
is
 
unknown.
 
Despite
 
this,
 
one
 
possible
 
determination
 
of
 
CWD
 
may
 
be
 
that
 
it
 
evolved
 
from
 
a
 
preexisting
 
disease.
 
One
 
such
 
possibility
 
that
 
researchers
 
know
 
of
 
is
 
called
 
transmissible
 
spongiform
 
encephalopathy
 
(Emer ging)
.
 
It
 
shares
 
similar
 
ways
 
of
 
affecting
 
the
 
brain
 
and
 
killing
 
animals
 
-
 
specifically
 
livestock
 
including
 
sheep
 
and
 
goats.
 
This
 
disease,
 
which
 
ranchers
 
often
 
label
 
as
 
TSE,
 
or
 
“scrapie”
 
is
 
similar
 
enough
 
to
 
CWD
 
to
 
where
 
they
 
have
 
determined
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
best
 
possible
 
origin
 
(Merck).
 
Due
 
to
 
the
 
disease’ s
 
relatedness
 
in
 
transmission,
 
effects,
 
and
 
symptoms,
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
likely
 
origin
 
of
 
chronic
 
wasting
 
disease
 
through
 
the
 
evolution
 
of
 
the
 
virus.
 
 
 
TSE
 
is
 
a
 
disease
 
transmitted
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
or
 
similar
 
ways
 
when
 
compared
 
to
 
CWD.
 
These
 
diseases
 
can
 
be
 
transmitted
 
in
 
three
 
ways:
 
through
 
bodily
 
fluids,
 
contaminated
 
environmental
 
factors
 
(such
 
as
 
water
 
or
 
food),
 
and
 
infected
 
carcasses
 
(U.S.
 
Geological
 
Survey).
 
An
 
example
 
of
 
how
 
this
 
may
 
work
 
is
 
infected
 
livestock
 
leaving
 
waste
 
behind
 
in
 
a
 
pasture
 
and
 
deer
 
passing
 
through
 
that
 
pasture
 
and
 
being
 
exposed
 
(U.S.
 
Geological
 
Survey).
 
Once
 
one
 
wild
 
animal
 
has

become
 
infected,
 
it
 
can
 
easily
 
be
 
passed
 
to
 
others
 
which
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
spread
 
through
 
a
 
population
 
and
 
infect
 
more
 
individuals
 
throughout
 
the
 
following
 
generations.
  
 
 
Alongside
 
the
 
many
 
ways
 
that
 
TSE
 
could
 
have
 
been
 
transmitted
 
to
 
cervid
 
populations,
 
the
 
way
 
it
 
affects
 
sheep
 
and
 
goat
 
species
 
makes
 
it
 
clear
 
that
 
it
 
has
 
commonalities
 
with
 
CWD
 
(3).
 
Both
 
diseases
 
have
 
been
 
diagnosed
 
as
 
misfolded
 
proteins
 
in
 
the
 
brain
 
(Merck).
 
These
 
proteins
 
are
 
known
 
as
 
prions,
 
which
 
are
 
often
 
produced
 
by
 
mammals
 
for
 
common
 
cellular
 
functions
 
and
 
then
 
recycled
 
or
 
degraded.
 
This
 
abnormal
 
folding
 
of
 
proteins
 
causes
 
the
 
cells
 
to
 
cease
 
being
 
broken
 
down
 
and
 
to
 
instead
 
collect
 
in
 
the
 
brain
 
(Merck).
 
This
 
leads
 
to
 
neurological
 
damage
 
and
 
eventual
 
death
 
by
 
eliminating
 
brain
 
cells
 
(Emer ging).
 
Prions
 
are
 
resistant
 
to
 
heat,
 
cold,
 
and
 
chemicals
 
which
 
makes
 
them
 
difficult
 
to
 
eliminate
 
in
 
different
 
environments
 
(Emer ging).
 
Their
 
resistance
 
to
 
natural
 
disease
 
elimination
 
methods
 
may
 
have
 
contributed
 
to
 
the
 
spread
 
of
 
chronic
 
wasting
 
disease
 
among
 
deer
 
populations.
  
 
 
Having
 
the
 
same
 
cause
 
between
 
differing
 
diseases
 
can
 
create
 
similarities
 
between
 
how
 
symptoms
 
of
 
a
 
disease
 
act
 
(Emer ging).
 
Symptoms
 
that
 
are
 
commonly
 
held
 
between
 
TSE
 
and
 
chronic
 
wasting
 
disease
 
include
 
behavioral
 
changes,
 
excessive
 
drooling,
 
weight
 
loss,
 
hair
 
pulling,
 
and
 
incoordination
 
(Merck
 
&
 
Chronic).
 
Related
 
symptoms
 
not
 
only
 
show
 
that
 
the
 
two
 
are
 
related
 
in
 
the
 
ways
 
that
 
they
 
infect,
 
but
 
also
 
in
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
ways
 
of
 
development
 
and
 
patterns
 
of
 
their
 
decline
 
in
 
health
 
(Chronic).
 
Similarities
 
in
 
symptomatology
 
lead
 
to
 
the
 
same
 
path
 
from
 
differing
 
disease
 
origin.
 
 
Due
 
to
 
transmission,
 
cause,
 
and
 
symptomatic
 
similarities,
 
researchers
 
have
 
theorized
 
that
 
chronic
 
wasting
 
disease
 
evolved
 
and
 
adapted
 
to
 
wild
 
cervid
 
habitats
 
from
 
a
 
livestock
 
virus
 
known
 
as
 
TSE.
 
The
 
easy
 
transmission
 
of
 
infectious
 
prions
 
through
 
contaminated
 
environmental
 
factors,
 
carcasses
 
and
 
bodily
 
fluids
 
from
 
livestock
 
made
 
a
 
large
 
contribution
 
to
 
how
 
it
 
spread

Brooks

onto
 
wild
 
populations.
 
Similarities
 
between
 
the
 
symptoms
 
further
 
support
 
the
 
connection
 
between
 
the
 
two
 
diseases.
 
These
 
factor
 
together ,
 
suggesting
 
a
 
strong
 
evolutionary
 
link
 
between
 
them.
