        "quote": "Despite this, one possible determination of CWD may be that it evolved from a preexisting disease. One such possibility that researchers know of is called transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (Emerging). ... Due to the diseaseâ€™s relatedness in transmission, effects, and symptoms, it is the most likely origin of chronic wasting disease through the evolution of the virus."

        "quote": "Having the same cause between differing diseases can create similarities between how symptoms of a disease act (Emerging). Symptoms that are commonly held between TSE and chronic wasting disease include behavioral changes, excessive drooling, weight loss, hair pulling, and incoordination (Merck & Chronic)."
