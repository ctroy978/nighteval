Overall Score: 14 / 20

Criteria:
thesis_argument  Score: 3
Evidence:
Due to the diseaseâ€™s relatedness in transmission, effects, and symptoms, it is the most likely
origin of chronic wasting disease through the evolution of the virus.
Explanation:
Clear thesis linking TSE to CWD via similarities, adequately addresses prompt.
Advice:
Strengthen originality by exploring alternative origins or implications.

organization_coherence  Score: 3
Evidence:
TSE is a disease transmitted in the same or similar ways when compared to CWD. These diseases can be
transmitted in three ways: through bodily fluids, contaminated environmental factors (such as water
or food), and infected carcasses (U.S. Geological Survey).
Explanation:
Logical structure with paragraphs on transmission, effects, symptoms; effective flow.
Advice:
Improve transitions between sections for smoother progression.

development_support  Score: 3
Evidence:
Both diseases have been diagnosed as misfolded proteins in the brain (Merck). These proteins are
known as prions, which are often produced by mammals for common cellular functions and then recycled
or degraded.
Explanation:
Uses credible sources to support claims on transmission and prions effectively.
Advice:
Integrate more diverse examples or data for richer evidence.

critical_analysis  Score: 3
Evidence:
Having the same cause between differing diseases can create similarities between how symptoms of a
disease act (Emerging). Symptoms that are commonly held between TSE and chronic wasting disease
include behavioral changes, excessive drooling, weight loss, hair pulling, and incoordination (Merck
Explanation:
Clear interpretation of similarities, showing engagement with topic.
Advice:
Add deeper insights on evolutionary mechanisms or counterarguments.

language_style_mechanics  Score: 2
Evidence:
This abnormal folding of proteins causes the cells to cease being broken down and to instead collect
in the brain (Merck). This leads to neurological damage and eventual death by eliminating brain
cells (Emerging).
Explanation:
Readable with awkward phrasing and formatting errors affecting clarity.
Advice:
Proofread for spacing issues and refine sentence variety.
