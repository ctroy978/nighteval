The
 
Berlin
 
Wall
 
After
 
World
 
War
 
II
 
ended
 
in
 
1945,
 
peace
 
conferences
 
at
 
Yalta
 
and
 
Potsdam
 
split
 
Germany
 
into
 
allied
 
occupation
 
zones.
 
The
 
western
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
country
 
went
 
to
 
the
 
United
 
States,
 
Great
 
Britain
 
and
 
France,
 
while
 
the
 
eastern
 
part
 
went
 
to
 
the
 
Soviet
 
Union
 
(“Berlin
 
Wall”).
 
The
 
City
 
of
 
Berlin
 
was
 
split
 
into
 
similar
 
sectors,
 
with
 
the
 
allies
 
taking
 
the
 
western
 
half,
 
and
 
the
 
Soviets
 
taking
 
the
 
eastern
 
half.
 
The
 
existence
 
of
 
West
 
Berlin
 
was
 
out
 
of
 
place
 
within
 
communist
 
East
 
Germany ,
 
as
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
conspicuously
 
capitalist
 
city.
 
The
 
Russians
 
began
 
maneuvering
 
to
 
drive
 
the
 
United
 
States,
 
Britain
 
and
 
France
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
city
 
for
 
good
 
(“Berlin
 
Wall”).
 
Their
 
efforts
 
were
 
unsuccessful
 
and
 
only
 
led
 
to
 
rising
 
tensions
 
between
 
East
 
and
 
West
 
Berlin,
 
with
 
millions
 
of
 
East
 
Germans
 
fleeing
 
to
 
the
 
West
 
to
 
escape
 
the
 
repressive
 
political
 
system
 
and
 
limited
 
economic
 
opportunities.
 
The
 
amount
 
of
 
refugees
 
became
 
so
 
excessive
 
that
 
East
 
Germany
 
constructed
 
the
 
Berlin
 
Wall.
 
The
 
wall
 
divided
 
families
 
and
 
communities,
 
and
 
was
 
inherently
 
controlling,
 
as
 
its
 
primary
 
purpose
 
was
 
to
 
restrict
 
and
 
regulate
 
the
 
movement
 
of
 
East
 
Germans.
 
This
 
reinforced
 
the
 
overall
 
authoritarian
 
control
 
of
 
the
 
German
 
Democratic
 
Republic
 
and
 
Soviet
 
influence
 
over
 
Eastern
 
Europe
 
(“Berlin
 
Wall”).
 
The
 
Wall
 
was
 
originally
 
built
 
in
 
1961
 
under
 
Soviet
 
leader
 
Nikita
 
Khruschchev ,
 
however
 
when
 
Mikhail
 
Gorbachev
 
was
 
elected
 
General
 
Secretary
 
of
 
the
 
Communist
 
Party
 
of
 
the
 
Soviet
 
Union
 
in
 
1985,
 
the
 
whole
 
perspective
 
of
 
the
 
Wall
 
changed.
 
Gorbachev’ s
 
ideology
 
was
 
unexpected
 
given
 
the
 
historical
 
conflict
 
of
 
the
 
Soviet
 
Union
 
(“Mikhail
 
Gorbachev”).
 
Ultimately ,
 
as
 
time
 
went
 
on,
 
the
 
Soviet
 
leader
 
allowed
 
the
 
Berlin
 
wall
 
to
 
come

down
 
because
 
he
 
had
 
a
 
broader
 
vision
 
for
 
the
 
Soviet
 
Union
 
and
 
its
 
role
 
in
 
the
 
world.
 
The
 
main
 
reasons
 
for
 
this
 
are
 
that
 
he
 
wanted
 
a
 
more
 
dynamic
 
socialist
 
system,
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
need
 
for
 
internal
 
economic
 
recovery ,
 
and
 
he
 
desired
 
to
 
reposition
 
the
 
soviet
 
union
 
as
 
a
 
cooperative
 
global
 
power .
 
 
Gorbachev
 
allowed
 
for
 
the
 
Berlin
 
wall
 
to
 
be
 
taken
 
down
 
because
 
he
 
sought
 
a
 
greater
 
purpose
 
for
 
the
 
Soviet
 
Union
 
made
 
possible
 
by
 
a
 
socialist
 
system
 
with
 
a
 
more
 
innovative
 
approach.
 
Perestroika
 
was
 
Gorbachev’ s
 
policy
 
introduced
 
in
 
1985
 
to
 
reform
 
the
 
Soviet
 
Union’ s
 
stagnant
 
economy
 
and
 
political
 
system.
 
Gorbachev’ s
 
perestroika
 
program
 
loosened
 
centralized
 
control
 
of
 
many
 
businesses,
 
allowing
 
some
 
farmers
 
and
 
manufacturers
 
to
 
decide
 
for
 
themselves
 
which
 
products
 
to
 
make,
 
how
 
many
 
to
 
produce,
 
and
 
what
 
to
 
charge
 
for
 
them.
 
This
 
went
 
against
 
the
 
strict
 
price
 
controls
 
that
 
were
 
typical
 
for
 
Soviet
 
economic
 
policies
 
(“Perestroika”).
 
It
 
led
 
to
 
the
 
rise
 
of
 
privately
 
owned
 
stores,
 
restaurants
 
and
 
manufacturers.
 
Gorbachev
 
also
 
reduced
 
restrictions
 
on
 
foreign
 
trade.
 
Such
 
aspects
 
of
 
free-market
 
capitalism
 
had
 
not
 
been
 
seen
 
in
 
the
 
Soviet
 
Union
 
since
 
the
 
brief
 
New
 
Economic
 
Policy
 
of
 
Vladimir
 
Lenin,
 
instituted
 
in
 
1922
 
after
 
the
 
Russian
 
civil
 
war
 
(“Glasnost”).
 
Glasnost
 
was
 
introduced
 
in
 
1985
 
with
 
the
 
design
 
to
 
foster
 
a
 
more
 
participatory
 
and
 
dynamic
 
socialist
 
system
 
by
 
relaxing
 
censorship,
 
allowing
 
media,
 
intellectuals,
 
and
 
citizens
 
to
 
openly
 
criticize
 
government
 
policies,
 
and
 
expose
 
corruption.
 
This
 
created
 
a
 
climate
 
of
 
political
 
engagement,
 
empowering
 
citizens
 
to
 
demand
 
reforms
 
(“Glasnost”).
 
These
 
policies
 
show
 
that
 
Gorbachev
 
was
 
striving
 
for
 
a
 
more
 
dynamic
 
socialist
 
system
 
because
 
the
 
policies
 
he
 
installed
 
paved
 
the
 
way
 
for
 
East
 
Germans
 
to
 
demand
 
reforms
 
and
 
protest
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
Berlin
 
Wall
 
removed.
 
However ,
 
these
 
reforms
 
placed
 
other
 
considerations
 
on
 
the
 
economy
 
for
 
Mikhail
 
Gorbachev .
 
 
The
 
Soviet
 
leader ’s
 
recognition
 
of
 
the
 
Union’ s
 
dire
 
need
 
for
 
internal
 
economic
 
recovery
 
shifted
 
concern
 
away
 
from
 
the
 
Berlin
 
Wall.
 
By
 
1985,
 
the
 
time
 
that
 
Gorbachev
 
took
 
office,
 
the

Willis

soviet
 
economy
 
had
 
been
 
stagnant
 
for
 
20
 
years.
 
The
 
country’ s
 
gross
 
national
 
product
 
dropped
 
from
 
5.8%
 
in
 
1940
 
to
 
2.6%
 
in
 
1970
 
(“Consequences
 
of”).
 
The
 
region’ s
 
large
 
energy
 
and
 
raw
 
material
 
base
 
had
 
prompted
 
the
 
Soviet
 
economy
 
to
 
rely
 
little
 
on
 
foreign
 
trade
 
throughout
 
history .
 
It
 
was
 
recorded
 
in
 
1985
 
that
 
exports
 
and
 
imports
 
accounted
 
for
 
just
 
4
 
percent
 
of
 
the
 
Soviet
 
gross
 
national
 
product
 
(“Consequences
 
of”).
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
Soviet
 
Union’ s
 
trade
 
was
 
with
 
communist
 
countries,
 
usually
 
in
 
Eastern
 
Europe.
 
Although
 
Gorbachev
 
had
 
instituted
 
the
 
Perestroika
 
and
 
Glasnost
 
reforms
 
to
 
jumpstart
 
the
 
inactive
 
Soviet
 
economy ,
 
many
 
of
 
them
 
had
 
the
 
opposite
 
effect
 
(“Perestroika”).
 
For
 
example,
 
the
 
agricultural
 
sector
 
had
 
provided
 
food
 
at
 
low
 
cost
 
due
 
to
 
decades
 
of
 
heavy
 
government
 
subsidies.
 
However ,
 
it
 
could
 
now
 
charge
 
higher
 
prices
 
in
 
the
 
marketplace.
 
Many
 
soviets
 
could
 
not
 
afford
 
these
 
prices.
 
Government
 
spending
 
and
 
Soviet
 
debt
 
reached
 
an
 
all
 
time
 
high,
 
and
 
workers
 
demanding
 
higher
 
wages
 
led
 
to
 
dangerous
 
inflation
 
(“Perestroika”).
  
Unlike
 
past
 
Soviet
 
interventions
 
Gorbachev’ s
 
economic
 
priorities
 
meant
 
he
 
avoided
 
military
 
action.
 
This
 
shift
 
reflected
 
Gorbachev’ s
 
practical
 
vision
 
to
 
modernize
 
the
 
Soviet
 
Union,
 
prioritizing
 
economic
 
survival
 
over
 
imperial
 
control.
 
Ultimately ,
 
that
 
enabled
 
the
 
Wall’s
 
fall
 
on
 
November
 
9,
 
1989.
 
Furthermore,
 
Gorbachev
 
wanted
 
the
 
Union
 
to
 
have
 
less
 
political
 
intervention.
 
 
Gorbachev’ s
 
vision
 
to
 
reposition
 
the
 
Soviet
 
Union
 
as
 
a
 
cooperative
 
global
 
power ,
 
embodied
 
in
 
the
 
Sinatra
 
Doctrine
 
and
 
pursuit
 
of
 
détente,
 
allowed
 
the
 
Berlin
 
Wall
 
to
 
fall
 
by
 
enabling
 
East
 
German
 
protests
 
to
 
succeed.
 
The
 
Sinatra
 
Doctrine
 
a
 
policy
 
allowing
 
neighboring
 
Warsaw
 
Pact
 
countries
 
to
 
resolve
 
their
 
internal
 
affairs
 
and
 
determine
 
their
 
political
 
evolution
 
(“Sinatra
 
Doctrine”).
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
democratic
 
reforms
 
were
 
enabled
 
across
 
the
 
Eastern
 
Bloc.
 
One
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
notable
 
was
 
Poland’ s
 
Solidarity
 
movement,
 
which
 
secured
 
semi-free
 
elections
 
in
 
1989.
 
In
 
East
 
Germany ,
 
it
 
signaled
 
no
 
Soviet
 
intervention,
 
emboldening
 
other
 
protests
 
as
 
well

(“Poland’ s
 
Solidarity”).
 
Gorbachev’ s
 
non-intervention,
 
rooted
 
in
 
the
 
Sinatra
 
Doctrine,
 
allowed
 
East
 
German
 
protests
 
to
 
escalate.
 
The
 
Wall
 
fell
 
on
 
November
 
9,
 
1989,
 
after
 
a
 
bureaucratic
 
error
 
by
 
a
 
German
 
Democratic
 
Republic
 
official,
 
with
 
Gorbachev
 
refusing
 
to
 
deploy
 
Soviet
 
troops
 
(“Sinatra
 
Doctrine”).
 
This
 
ultimately
 
shows
 
that
 
Gorbachev’ s
 
desire
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
Soviet
 
Union
 
a
 
more
 
cooperative
 
global
 
power
 
led
 
him
 
to
 
allow
 
the
 
wall
 
to
 
come
 
down,
 
because
 
he
 
knew
 
that
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
integrate
 
the
 
Soviet
 
Union
 
into
 
a
 
cooperative
 
global
 
framework,
 
he
 
had
 
to
 
reduce
 
Cold
 
War
 
tensions
 
and
 
remove
 
the
 
past
 
authoritarian
 
control.
 
 
In
 
conclusion,
 
the
 
Soviet
 
leader
 
allowed
 
the
 
Berlin
 
wall
 
to
 
come
 
down
 
because
 
he
 
had
 
a
 
broader
 
vision
 
for
 
the
 
Soviet
 
Union
 
and
 
its
 
role
 
in
 
the
 
world.
 
The
 
main
 
reasons
 
for
 
this
 
are
 
that
 
he
 
wanted
 
a
 
more
 
dynamic
 
socialist
 
system,
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
need
 
for
 
internal
 
economic
 
recovery ,
 
and
 
he
 
desired
 
to
 
reposition
 
the
 
soviet
 
union
 
as
 
a
 
cooperative
 
global
 
power .
