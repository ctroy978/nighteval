NEOM’ s
 
“The
 
Line”,
 
Eco-Friendly
 
Haven
 
of
 
The
 
Future
 
In
 
an
 
era
 
where
 
urbanization
 
and
 
environmental
 
sustainability
 
are
 
at
 
odds,
 
Saudi
 
Arabia's
 
NEOM
 
project
 
introduces
 
"The
 
Line,"
 
a
 
revolutionary
 
concept
 
that
 
promises
 
to
 
harmonize
 
urban
 
living
 
with
 
nature.
 
Launched
 
in
 
2017
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
Vision
 
2030,
 
"The
 
Line"
 
is
 
envisioned
 
as
 
a
 
170-kilometer -long,
 
car-free
 
smart
 
city
 
that
 
operates
 
entirely
 
on
 
renewable
 
energy,
 
preserving
 
95%
 
of
 
the
 
surrounding
 
land
 
for
 
nature
 
(NEOMTheLine).
 
This
 
ambitious
 
project
 
aims
 
to
 
redefine
 
urban
 
development
 
by
 
prioritizing
 
human
 
health,
 
well-being,
 
and
 
environmental
 
conservation
 
over
 
traditional
 
infrastructure.
 
Despite
 
logistical
 
hurdles,
 
"The
 
Line"
 
stands
 
as
 
a
 
visionary
 
urban
 
experiment
 
and
 
an
 
ideal
 
place
 
to
 
live
 
due
 
to
 
its
 
pioneering
 
sustainability
 
features,
 
innovative
 
urban
 
design,
 
and
 
focus
 
on
 
enhancing
 
residents’
 
quality
 
of
 
life.
 
One
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
compelling
 
aspects
 
of
 
"The
 
Line"
 
is
 
its
 
commitment
 
to
 
sustainability .
 
The
 
city
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
run
 
entirely
 
on
 
renewable
 
energy,
 
eliminating
 
carbon
 
emissions
 
and
 
reducing
 
the
 
environmental
 
impact
 
of
 
urban
 
living
 
(NEOMTheLine).
 
By
 
preserving
 
95%
 
of
 
the
 
surrounding
 
land
 
for
 
nature,
 
"The
 
Line"
 
minimizes
 
urban
 
sprawl
 
and
 
protects
 
biodiversity ,
 
setting
 
a
 
new
 
standard
 
for
 
eco-friendly
 
city
 
planning.
 
Furthermore,
 
the
 
compact
 
design
 
of
 
the
 
city,
 
with
 
a
 
footprint
 
of
 
just
 
34
 
square
 
kilometers
 
for
 
9
 
million
 
residents,
 
significantly
 
reduces
 
the
 
infrastructure
 
needed,
 
leading
 
to
 
greater
 
efficiency
 
and
 
lower
 
resource
 
consumption.
 
This
 
aligns

O’Shea

with
 
the
 
United
 
Nations'
 
Sustainable
 
Development
 
Goal
 
11,
 
which
 
strives
 
to
 
make
 
cities
 
inclusive,
 
safe,
 
resilient,
 
and
 
sustainable
 
(UNSDGCities).
 
"The
 
Line"
 
revolutionizes
 
urban
 
design
 
by
 
eliminating
 
cars
 
and
 
roads,
 
thereby
 
reducing
 
traffic
 
congestion
 
and
 
pollution.
 
Residents
 
will
 
have
 
all
 
daily
 
essentials
 
within
 
a
 
five-minute
 
walk,
 
promoting
 
a
 
healthier
 
and
 
more
 
active
 
lifestyle
 
(NEOMTheLine).
 
For
 
longer
 
distances,
 
a
 
high-speed
 
rail
 
system
 
will
 
provide
 
efficient
 
transportation,
 
with
 
end-to-end
 
transit
 
times
 
of
 
just
 
20
 
minutes.
 
This
 
design
 
not
 
only
 
enhances
 
convenience
 
but
 
also
 
fosters
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
community
 
by
 
encouraging
 
pedestrian
 
interactions.
 
Research
 
has
 
shown
 
that
 
walkable
 
cities
 
promote
 
active
 
living,
 
which
 
can
 
lead
 
to
 
longer
 
and
 
healthier
 
lives.
 
Regular
 
walking
 
reduces
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
chronic
 
diseases
 
such
 
as
 
Type
 
2
 
diabetes
 
and
 
heart
 
disease,
 
and
 
improves
 
mental
 
health
 
by
 
reducing
 
stress
 
and
 
increasing
 
happiness
 
(CNUW alkable).
 
This
 
project
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
integrate
 
nature
 
seamlessly
 
into
 
urban
 
living.
 
Residents
 
will
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
nature
 
within
 
a
 
two-minute
 
walk,
 
with
 
diverse
 
open
 
spaces
 
and
 
vertical
 
gardens
 
that
 
provide
 
equitable
 
access
 
to
 
pristine
 
views
 
(NEOMTheLine).
 
This
 
close
 
proximity
 
to
 
green
 
spaces
 
not
 
only
 
enhances
 
the
 
aesthetic
 
appeal
 
of
 
the
 
city
 
but
 
also
 
contributes
 
to
 
the
 
mental
 
and
 
physical
 
well-being
 
of
 
its
 
inhabitants.
 
Studies
 
have
 
shown
 
that
 
access
 
to
 
green
 
spaces
 
can
 
reduce
 
stress,
 
improve
 
mood,
 
and
 
enhance
 
overall
 
well-being
 
(PMCGreenSpaces).
 
Additionally ,
 
the
 
city's
 
design
 
includes
 
microclimatic
 
spaces
 
that
 
ensure
 
optimal
 
sunlight,
 
shade,
 
and
 
ventilation,
 
creating
 
a
 
comfortable
 
living
 
environment
 
year-round.
 
"The
 
Line"
 
places
 
a
 
strong
 
emphasis
 
on
 
the
 
health
 
and
 
well-being
 
of
 
its
 
residents.
 
The
 
city
 
will
 
offer
 
world-class
 
preventative
 
healthcare,
 
aiming
 
to
 
increase
 
life
 
expectancy
 
and
 
improve
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
(NEOMTheLine).
 
With
 
zero
 
pollution
 
and
 
no
 
traffic,
 
residents
 
will

O’Shea

breathe
 
cleaner
 
air
 
and
 
avoid
 
the
 
stresses
 
associated
 
with
 
commuting.
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
American
 
Thoracic
 
Society ,
 
reducing
 
air
 
pollution
 
can
 
lead
 
to
 
rapid
 
health
 
improvements,
 
including
 
decreased
 
respiratory
 
symptoms
 
and
 
lower
 
rates
 
of
 
cardiovascular
 
illness
 
within
 
weeks
 
(ATSAirPollution).
 
By
 
eliminating
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
personal
 
vehicles,
 
residents
 
can
 
save
 
on
 
average
 
$12,000
 
per
 
year
 
that
 
would
 
otherwise
 
be
 
spent
 
on
 
car
 
ownership
 
costs,
 
including
 
purchase
 
of
 
the
 
vehicle,
 
insurance,
 
maintenance,
 
and
 
fuel
 
(MoneyGeekCar).
 
This
 
financial
 
benefit
 
can
 
significantly
 
enhance
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
for
 
residents
 
due
 
to
 
these
 
factors.
 
The
 
structure
 
is
 
not
 
just
 
a
 
physical
 
space
 
but
 
a
 
cognitive
 
city
 
that
 
leverages
 
advanced
 
technologies
 
to
 
predict
 
and
 
respond
 
to
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
its
 
residents.
 
This
 
smart
 
city
 
approach
 
ensures
 
that
 
services
 
are
 
efficient
 
and
 
tailored
 
to
 
individual
 
preferences,
 
enhancing
 
the
 
overall
 
living
 
experience
 
(NEOMTheLine).
 
Smart
 
cities
 
like
 
"The
 
Line"
 
use
 
technology
 
to
 
optimize
 
services
 
and
 
improve
 
the
 
lives
 
of
 
residents
 
by
 
providing
 
efficient
 
transportation,
 
energy
 
management,
 
and
 
public
 
services
 
(PlanteMoranSmartCities).
 
Also,
 
the
 
project
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
create
 
large-scale
 
job
 
opportunities,
 
fostering
 
economic
 
growth
 
and
 
innovation.
 
The
 
integration
 
of
 
nature
 
and
 
technology
 
allows
 
for
 
a
 
harmonious
 
living
 
environment
 
where
 
residents
 
can
 
enjoy
 
both
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
modern
 
amenities
 
and
 
the
 
tranquility
 
of
 
natural
 
surroundings.
 
 
Advancing
 
technology
 
will
 
not
 
only
 
improve
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
life,
 
but
 
also
 
change
 
the
 
way
 
restaurants
 
and
 
shopping
 
occur .
 
In
 
"The
 
Line,"
 
restaurants
 
and
 
stores
 
will
 
be
 
seamlessly
 
integrated
 
into
 
the
 
community
 
structure,
 
ensuring
 
that
 
all
 
daily
 
essentials
 
are
 
within
 
a
 
five-minute
 
walk
 
for
 
residents.
 
This
 
design
 
prioritizes
 
walkability
 
and
 
community
 
interaction,
 
making
 
commercial
 
spaces
 
easily
 
accessible
 
without
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
cars.
 
The
 
city's
 
high-speed
 
rail
 
system,
 
allowing
 
end-to-end
 
transit
 
in
 
just
 
20
 
minutes,
 
further
 
enhances
 
connectivity ,
 
enabling
 
residents
 
and
 
visitors
 
to
 
explore
 
various
 
commercial
 
offerings
 
across
 
the
 
170-kilometer
 
length
 
of
 
the
 
city.

With
 
a
 
projected
 
population
 
of
 
up
 
to
 
9
 
million
 
people,
 
"The
 
Line"
 
will
 
support
 
a
 
diverse
 
and
 
vibrant
 
commercial
 
landscape,
 
catering
 
to
 
a
 
wide
 
range
 
of
 
needs
 
and
 
preferences.
 
Operations
 
of
 
restaurants
 
and
 
stores
 
in
 
"The
 
Line"
 
will
 
be
 
characterized
 
by
 
a
 
strong
 
emphasis
 
on
 
sustainability
 
and
 
technological
 
innovation.
 
As
 
part
 
of
 
a
 
zero-carbon
 
city
 
powered
 
entirely
 
by
 
renewable
 
energy,
 
these
 
businesses
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
adopt
 
eco-friendly
 
practices,
 
such
 
as
 
using
 
sustainable
 
materials,
 
minimizing
 
waste,
 
and
 
possibly
 
sourcing
 
local
 
or
 
organic
 
ingredients
 
for
 
restaurants.
 
The
 
involvement
 
of
 
Topian,
 
NEOM's
 
food
 
company ,
 
suggests
 
that
 
there
 
may
 
be
 
innovative
 
food
 
production
 
and
 
distribution
 
systems
 
in
 
place,
 
potentially
 
offering
 
unique
 
and
 
sustainable
 
dining
 
options.
 
Additionally ,
 
the
 
city's
 
commitment
 
to
 
being
 
a
 
cognitive
 
city
 
means
 
that
 
commercial
 
operations
 
will
 
likely
 
leverage
 
advanced
 
technologies,
 
including
 
artificial
 
intelligence,
 
to
 
optimize
 
efficiency ,
 
personalize
 
customer
 
experiences,
 
and
 
manage
 
resources
 
effectively ,
 
setting
 
a
 
new
 
standard
 
for
 
urban
 
commerce.
 
In
 
conclusion,
 
"The
 
Line"
 
represents
 
a
 
bold
 
and
 
innovative
 
approach
 
to
 
urban
 
development
 
that
 
addresses
 
many
 
of
 
the
 
challenges
 
modern
 
cities
 
face.
 
Through
 
its
 
commitment
 
to
 
sustainability ,
 
advanced
 
urban
 
design,
 
integration
 
with
 
nature,
 
focus
 
on
 
health
 
and
 
wellbeing,
 
and
 
utilization
 
of
 
smart
 
technologies,
 
"The
 
Line"
 
offers
 
a
 
compelling
 
vision
 
for
 
the
 
future
 
of
 
urban
 
living.
 
While
 
there
 
are
 
execution
 
challenges,
 
the
 
potential
 
benefits
 
make
 
it
 
a
 
worthwhile
 
endeavor
 
and
 
an
 
ideal
 
place
 
to
 
live
 
for
 
those
 
seeking
 
a
 
harmonious
 
balance
 
between
 
technology
 
and
 
nature.
